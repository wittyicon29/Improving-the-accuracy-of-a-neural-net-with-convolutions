# Improving-the-accuracy-of-a-neural-net-with-convolutions
This repository will introduce the convolutions to be implemented into a neural network for improving it's accuracy. The neural net is the computer vision model trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. By implementing 3 convolutional layers the accuracy for the model jumps to around 97%.
